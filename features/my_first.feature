Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  Then I touch the "button" button
  Then I wait for 3 seconds
  Then I touch "Second"
  Then I wait for 3 seconds
  Then I type "Xebia" in the input field
  Then I press the search button
  Then I wait for 5 seconds
  Then I scroll down
  Then I wait for 2 seconds
  Then I execute some custom JS
  Then take picture
  Then I wait for 20 seconds
